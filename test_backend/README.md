# Backend Test Scripts

This directory contains example files and scripts for operating with the backend server.

## Requirements

- Backend server must be running (see backend project in the root folder)

## How to use it

Well... You will have to read the header of each script if you want to run it correctly...

Good luck, the scripts are created for testing porposes and it is supposed that only the speaker should use it... If you are reading this... Are you cheating?
