# Code experiment 1:

In this part of the workshop we will prepare, using default React code, a list of users that are working
in RTI with a tool. We will, basically, access to a list of users and show how many users are registered
in this tool.

To do this, you have already prepared a backend server running on:
http://pers-grhino001.sjcvirt.rti.com:8000

There is some API documentation autogenerated that indicates the kind of requests that can be done to the
server, you can see it in the backend doc address:
http://pers-grhino001.sjcvirt.rti.com:8000/docs

You can check that you have access to the server by just opening that link on a web browser.

NOTE: If you want to check this backend server, code is available in the backend folder of the repository,
but please, do it after the workshop, this is only for experiment porposes, so it is not a real part to
analyze during the workshop.

The experiment that we will do will be based on the frontend application, running react, that is already
prepared in the folder:

`frontend-app`

So let's start working with this:

## Step 1: Prepare the environment

Access to the folder frontend-app and open VS Code or your favourite IDE. You need to adjust the address
where the server is connected. It should be set by default, but you may run the backend server locally.
The address is set in the file:

`src/app/lib/api.ts`

To connect with the backend server if it runs locally, use the address: http://localhost:8000
To connect with the server runing online for the workshop, use the address: 

The frontend project is a NextJS application, you can run it executing the following command in the 
frontend-app folder as follows:

`npm run dev`

This will run the application in development mode. Please note that we want to run it on debug mode during
this workshop.
